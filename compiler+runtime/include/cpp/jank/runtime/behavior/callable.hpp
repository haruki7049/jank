       * 2. Is there an ambiguous fixed overload?
       * 3. How many fixed arguments are required before the packed args?
       *
       * We cannot perform the correct call without all of this information. Since function calls
       * are on the hottest path there is, we pack all of this into a single byte. Questions
       * 1 and 2 each get a bit and question 3 gets 6 bits to store the fixed arg count.
       *
       * From there, when we use it, we strip out the bit for question 2 and we switch/case on
       * the rest. This allows us to do a O(1) jump on the combination of whether it's variadic
       * and the required fixed args. Finally, we only need the question 2 bit to disambiguate
       * one branch of each switch.
       *
       * The ambiguity comes in this case:
       *
       * ```
       * (defn ambiguous
       *   ([a] 1)
       *   ([a & args] args))
       * (ambiguous :a)
       * ```
       *
       * When we call `ambiguous` with a single arg, we want it to match the fixed unary arity.
       * However, given just questions 1 and 3, we will see that we've met the required args
       * and that the function is variadic and we'll instead dispatch to the variadic arity, with
       * an empty sequence for `args`.
